I've chose to create this site to present my developing skills and show a part of my portfolio. 

#### First, i've decided to use Hugo

Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again. Hugo also presents many themes to help design and create the layout of the website.

#### Second, i branched the theme repository on my Github

i branched the theme i've chosen to be able to edit and adjust it to my liking.

#### Third, I connected it to Forestry and Netlify.

I used Netlify to deploy my website. and Forestry was used to edit and create the content of the site.

#### Lastly, i Used Visual Studio Code to edit files directly.

I opened and edited files that the theme provided to create and adjust the website to better represent me.

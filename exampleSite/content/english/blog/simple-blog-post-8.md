To complete my studies fro my Bachelors in Computer Science at Princess Nourah University i presented my graduation project. As a group, we presented a smart application, Pulse , that worked as a heart disease prediction and analysis.

We used Weighted Associative Classifier to conduct our prediction. We applied weighted attributes to all the requested inputs that have been calculated from our previous dataset to set each attributes importance for prediction. The app gives the users prediction reports on their chance of getting a heart disease. Addition to that the app also allowed users to monitor their heart rates either through their smartwatch or back camera flash. Users would get notified if any abnormalities occur. We've also established a way of communication between users and doctors to have easy access to them in case of any emergencies or concerns.

The app also provided a section that gives health tips to our audience to help maintain a healthier lifestyle to keep their heart health stable.

We used Android studios (Java) to develop our app and hosted our server on 00webhost. We created our database with MySQL. We collected a dataset from Keggle that has relevant information to apply our algorithm to.
